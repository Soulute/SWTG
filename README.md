# SWTG
Star Wars: the Gathering

Welcome!

STAR WARS: The Gathering (SWTG) is a custom *Star Wars*-themed card game played with the same rules as Magic: the Gathering. It is designed for fans of both *Magic* and *Star Wars* and can be treated like any other complete *Magic* expansion.
There are over 300 cards in the Main set, and smaller expansions based on recent movies or TV shows are added every year.

If you want to print your own "booster pack" at home, you can use the Booster Pack Maker to create custom image sheets of rarity-seeded random cards. The settings are configurable.
